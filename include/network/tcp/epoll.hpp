//  epoll was introduced in Linux 2.6. It provides best readiness notification facility in Linux just like what is for other *nix system like select and poll.
//
//  select: can monitor up to FD_SETSIZE file descriptors
//  poll: is expensive to perform linear scan to check readiness notification
//
//  Note: MacOS X does not support epoll. But it supports <Kernel Queues> which is very similar. You can also practice it in a Linxu vertual machine.
